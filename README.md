## Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (2021–2022)

## project Objective

To analyze and visualize road accident data from 2021 and 2022 in order to identify key trends, accident severity, contributing factors, and vehicle types involved. This helps stakeholders and authorities take preventive    measures to reduce accidents and casualties


## dataset used
<a href="https://github.com/keerthi-12334/data-analysis-excel-dashboard/blob/main/Road_Accident_RawData.xlsb">road accident data</a>

## KPIs(key performance indicator)

- total casualities taken after the accident (primary kpi)
- total casualities & percentage of total with respect to accident severity
- maximum casualities by type of vehicle
- total casualities with respect to vehicle type
- monthly trend showing comparison of casualities of 2021 and 2022
- maximum casualities by road type
- distribution of total casualities by road surface

## process

- Data Collection – Raw data collected from road accident records (Excel dataset).
- Data Cleaning & Preparation – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, categorized accidents by severity, vehicle type, and road type.
- Data Analysis – Aggregated totals, calculated percentages, and compared yearly data (2021 vs 2022).
- Visualization – Created dashboard using Excel with charts, KPIs, and slicers for interactive filtering.
- Interpretation – Derived insights on accident trends, severity, and contributing factors.

## project insight

- Severity: Majority of casualties are slight (84.1%), while fatal accidents are only 1.7%.
- Vehicle Involvement: Cars account for the highest casualties (333,485), highlighting them as the most accident-prone.
- Road Types: Single carriageway roads have the most casualties (309.7k), followed by dual carriageways.
- Road Surface: Most accidents occur on dry roads (67%), indicating that road condition is not the only factor—driver behavior and traffic congestion may play bigger roles.
- Trends: Casualties in 2021 were higher than in 2022, showing a slight reduction. However, certain months (like June–Oct) see more accidents.
- Other Vehicles: Motorcycles and vans contribute significantly to accident casualties after cars.

## dashboard
Future efforts should focus on road safety campaigns, stricter vehicle monitoring, and driver training to reduce fatalities and serious injuries.
